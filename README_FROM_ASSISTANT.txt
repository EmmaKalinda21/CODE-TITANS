Project edited by ChatGPT assistant on behalf of user.

What I changed:
- Added an 'index.html' landing page with download links.
- Added 'about.html' (About Us) describing developers.
- Created 'public/downloads/' with placeholder app-android.apk and app-ios.ipa.
- For React projects, added 'src/AboutUs.jsx' (best-effort). If your app uses react-router, you may need to wire the route manually.

How to preview locally:
- Desktop/web: open /mnt/data/farm_pro_edited/index.html
- Simple static server: from project root run:
    python -m http.server 8000
  then open http://localhost:8000

How to let users download app packages from your website:
- Replace files in public/downloads with your real signed .apk (Android) and .ipa (iOS).
- For iOS, distribute via TestFlight or an Apple-signed enterprise profile. Direct .ipa install requires device provisioning.
- For Android, users can install the .apk after enabling installs from unknown sources.

Notes:
- I didn't build APK/IPA here (tooling + signing needed). I created placeholder files. If you want, I can help generate an Android release APK if this project is a React Native or Cordova app â€” you'll need to confirm and provide keystore or allow me to show commands to run locally.
